# Cloned Projects

Welcome to my repository for cloned projects! Here you will find copies of various popular websites and apps that I have built based on their original designs and functions.

## Current Projects

- Netflix: A replica of the popular streaming service, complete with a library of movies and TV shows, a customizable profile, and a recommendation system.

- Todoist: A to-do list and task management app that allows users to create and organize tasks, set reminders, and track their progress.

- Spotify: A music streaming service with a library of millions of songs, personalized playlists, and the ability to discover new music based on your listening history.

## Usage

To use any of these projects, clone the repository and run the appropriate code to start the server and launch the app.
