<h1>Todo App</h1>
<p>
In this repo, I am had created the popular <a href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> application using <b>create-react-app</b> as a base from scratch using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & React Testing Library (unit & integration testing). In addition to the latter technologies, I had styled the application using Tailwind Css, I am still developing this application so the application is not responsive and some features are yet to be added.

# ðŸ›  Set Up for firebase

1. Create a Firebase project in the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase console</a>, click Add project, then follow the on-screen instructions to create a Firebase project or to add Firebase services to an existing GCP project.

2) Navigate to the Database section of the Firebase console. You'll be prompted to select an existing Firebase project. Follow the database creation workflow.
3) Select a starting mode for your Firebase Security Rules:

   - Production mode

     I know we are still in the learning phase but why not jump right into production  **make sure to review the [Understand Firebase Realtime Database Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security) section.**


    - Locked mode

      Denies all reads and writes from mobile and web clients. Your authenticated application servers can still access your database.

4.  Click **Done**.

When you enable Realtime Database, it also enables the API in the [Cloud API Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/apis/api/firebasedatabase.googleapis.com/overview).

## Firebase config object

To initialize Firebase in your app, you need to provide your app's Firebase project configuration.

```
import  firebase  from  "firebase/app";
import  "firebase/firestore";

const  firebaseConfig = firebase.initializeApp({
apiKey:  "API-KEY",
authDomain:  ""project-id.firebaseapp.com"",
databaseURL:  "https://project-id.firebaseio.com",
projectId:  "project-id",
storageBucket:  "project-id.appspot.com",
messagingSenderId:  "sender-id",
appId:  "app-id",
measurementId:  "G-measurement-id",
});

export { firebaseConfig  as  firebase };
```
